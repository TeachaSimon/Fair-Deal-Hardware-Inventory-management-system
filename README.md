Inventory Management System

This is a simple Inventory Management System implemented using Python's tkinter library and SQLite database. The system allows users to add, view, update, and remove items from the inventory, as well as change their availability status.
Features

The Inventory Management System has the following features:

    Add items to the inventory with details such as item sold, quantity, item price, and category.
    View and display items in a tabular format with the ability to select and view item details.
    Update item details including quantity, item price, category, and availability status.
    Remove items from the inventory.
    Change the availability status of an item from "Sold" to "Available" or vice versa.

Prerequisites

The following modules are required to run the Inventory Management System:

    Python 3.x
    tkinter library
    sqlite3 module

How to Use

    Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
    Install the required modules using pip, if they are not already installed. For example:

pip install tk

    Download the code and save it in a file with the .py extension (e.g. inventory_system.py).
    Run the code using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
    The Inventory Management System GUI will open with options to add, view, update, and remove items from the inventory, as well as change their availability status.
    Use the buttons and fields provided in the GUI to interact with the system as needed.
    The system uses an SQLite database file ('Inventory.db') to store the inventory data. The database file will be created in the same directory where the code is saved.

Note

    The system uses tkinter simpledialog to prompt for user input when adding or updating items. Make sure your system supports tkinter and the simpledialog module.
    The system uses tkinter messagebox to display messages and error dialogs. Make sure your system supports tkinter and the messagebox module.
    The system uses an SQLite database to store inventory data. Make sure you have SQLite installed on your system or use an SQLite library that is compatible with your system.
